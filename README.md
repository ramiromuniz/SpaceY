## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

SpaceX has revolutionized the commercial space industry by making space travel more cost-effective. The Falcon 9 rocket, advertised at a launch price of $62 million, offers a more affordable alternative to traditional service providers who charge over $165 million per launch. A significant factor contributing to this cost-effectiveness is SpaceX's ability to reuse the Falcon 9's first stage. This project aims to leverage publicly available data and machine learning models to predict the reusability of this first stage.

## ðŸ“„ Research Questions

- What impact do factors like payload mass, launch location, flight frequency, and orbital destination have on the successful landing of the first stage?
- Has there been an increase in successful landings over time?
- Which machine learning algorithm is most suitable for binary classification in predicting first stage landing success?
